@9a3tan no issue, it's you that found the bug? fixing it right now.
@9a3tan no, that should never happen, but now that you mention it, I'm going to check.
@9a3tan oops? probably you found a bug. News ASAP, thanks.
@9a3tan thanks, the bug is present in *every* version of Redis. VEery cool you discovered it
@9a3tan the fix is trivial, but testing it needs some more care.
@aaronblohowiak delay is only an extra layer of protection, an agreement protocol is used.
@aaronblohowiak great notes!
@aaronblohowiak you should really group those into a big blog post, it's very good nodes IMHO.
@aarsilv @nodejs @DoodleOrDie whoot! Thanks!
@Aashay I and Pieter both have access to this account, but currently it's me (@antirez) to reply to questions.
@Aashay Thanks, issue open, we'll get this fixed before 2.8 for sure, and possibly back porting it into 2.6 if possible.
@Aashay there is no easy way unfortunately? it's definitely something that needs to be improved. Are you using Redis 2.6 or 2.4?
A big number of small tasks to do in order to push 2.8 forward, better to move in that side to reach beta ASAP...

@abulte actually, we're going to fix that in the coming weeks, so this confusion will go away. Stay tuned!
@abulte but you are right the install page doesn't mention many of these 
@abulte I meant "java is needed only at build time" :)
@abulte I think it's the protobufs (used for client libraries)
@abulte java is only at build time. Having the web UI available from any machine in the cluster is a plus imo /cc @jdoliner
@abulte Just wait 'till the next release ;)
@abulte Merci!, si jamais vous rencontrez des probl?mes/avez des suggestions, tout commentaire est bienvenu :)
. @abulte my list says Ubuntu 10.04+, Mint, Debian 6+, CentOS 6+ in 32-bit and 64-bit. Plus OS X.
@abulte Thanks Alexandre!
@abulte there was a big slow-down with the clustering release. We should be able to get the numbers back up in a month or two.
@abulte we didn't do any perf tuning in the 1st version. Arch-wise all necessary things should be in place, but we'll have to tune diff bits
@abulte We use google closure to build the JS driver, which is used in data explorer. Java can be hacked out, but it's not recommended.
@abulte will be doing a bit more testing before updating the page as we want to be as sure as possible it works as expected
@abulte you're absolutely correct! (no docs about this yet though)
@acoburn4 Glad you enjoy it! Have fun.

@adhorn <3
@adr Great, looking forward to working this out!
@adrinavarro however it likely will break almost nothing in the real world...
@adrinavarro yes I'm thinking about not including this in 2.8, but in 3.0

@aemadrid Absolutely, we hear you. Thanks for reaching out!
@aeoth @joshuamck there's at least one robotic couch that uses me. I've also been spotted in a housetruck.
@afilimonov I guess @jchris did that :)
@afilimonov @jchris I can do N-Master replication.
@afilimonov @jchris The original question shouldn?t be which replication is "better", mine just has a different focus while?
After benchmarking it is clear that the overhead imposed by notifications is non-trivial. Modifying the impl. to select subclasses of events
After considering all the implications, Redis Cluster is going to use its own failure detection and election things instead of Sentinel.
After more testing, the master-back reconfiguration feature of Sentinel was merged into 2.6 and 2.8.
After solving another tricky problem, I have to say that Redis is the bacon of my toolset, it makes everything better
after very detailed testing CONFIG REWRITE is now merged into 2.8 and unstable branches.

@agildehaus We're working on getting the pull request accepted for Homebrew: https://olegdb.org/20989??
@agladysh however for sure all this is for 2.8 and we'll stress in the doc what to check to make sure code is compatible with 2.8
@agladysh in general yes, in the case of Redis security is pretty unimportant, bug upgrading is very important to avoid fixed bugs...
@agladysh @JoL1hAHN oh, right, so actually redis-lua should transform this as true/false as for SADD & company
@agladysh true, I'm assuming that most code assumes SET is always successful if it does not raise an exception

All considered, it is very likely that indeed SET in 2.8 will start returning :1 and :0 instead of "+OK". Details -> https://olegdb.org/Wlgctk?
all the recent work on EVALSHA back ported to 2.8. NetBSD compatibility pull request merged into 2.8 and unstable.
Already got a bug report about it, so WARNING: Cluster node-timeout is now in milliseconds in redis.conf no longer in seconds.
Also awesome that it was streamed live. More than 3k people following it on and off is very impressive. #redisconf
Also, if you think replication is about backups and restores, you need to get out of the 70s. #vmware #pgeast
Also when you need to look at Pub/Sub messages from redis-cli, make sure to use --csv option of redis-cli for a more compact output

Another change to the old Cluster design. In the new design failed over masters will be reconfigured automatically as slaves when back up.
Another factor was, Cluster nodes that are slaves handle the master address dynamically very well since they replicate the Node ID.

@antifuchs @mathiasx Let's play it off as a whimsical sense of humor. :)
@antifuchs @mathiasx Misspelling "egregious" in that context-- oh, the irony! Still, thanks for helping us out, glad you enjoyed the note.
@antirez here at @FreeLunaWiFi we're using #redis and #twemproxy (~40 instances) for our network monitoring system. They're great! :)
@antirez @kellabyte I don't think it's a tradeoff. Good APIs are nice on the surface, but bake a lot of subtle design to make ops work.
@anttisykari @antirez I disagree. With direction, a great writer with coding skills can make docs 100x better. Let's talk in a few months!

@BenediktNiessen Could you create a github issue and we'll see if we can help?
@BenediktNiessen rethink builds on Darwin. Would be great if you could get it running on FreeBSD, it should be pretty easy now.
@BenediktNiessen You can just clone the code and run make (that's how we build on OS X).
@benjaminnimmo we should ship a prod version by the end of the year. We're working hard on ironing out the last bits.
@benjaminnimmo when rethink becomes production ready, hundreds of millions of rows should be no problem.

@cartazio Cool, thanks. Trouble is, it's hard to tell if these tools are *good* without actually trying them, so I wanted to ask first.
@cartazio do it - it'll be a fun exercise!
@cartazio Fixed, minor CSS snafu. Thanks for the heads up!
@cartazio got it. main reasons we're using it are  1) the old site contained old info; 2) we want to be able to let you know when we're done

@cartazio it really does. I'd love to do it myself but can't because I already have 99 things on my proverbial plate :)

@charsyam basically osx Instruments and cachegrind (from valgrind)
@charsyam basically the to-slaves stream is identical for all the slaves in the new impl. On full resync the slave gets the global offset
@charsyam commenting in the pull request
@charsyam Hey! sorry for disturbing, I wonder if you have access to a system where the march issue exists. I think I've a partial cure.
@charsyam however the master also transfers its runid, so a given offset is only valid within a given master execution.
@charsyam I think videos will be available in the conference site in the next days
@charsyam Thanks, I want to include your patch but after the first failed attempt I want to be sure that this works in every case :-)
@charsyam thank you a lot, the idea is to use -march=native if 1) Is Linux. 2) Is a "make 32bit" build. But there is to test it somewhere.
@charsyam then it increments this offset every time data is read. On disconnection it asks starting from the specified offset.
@charsyam the replication offset is communicated by the master to the slave on a full resync, it's a private master->slave thing basically

@chrlns you can just copy the databases (and views in .-dirs) into the new database dir. Ubuntu makes this unnecessarily complicated.
@chrstphd as long as names are unique, isn't it ok instead of adding numerical values to associate to fields?
@chrstphd because it is not justifiable in this case to have a migration path, too many broken code for little actual gain...
@chrstphd exactly, now you can do similar things without the need to modify the client code, and you can check stuff like expires as well.
@chrstphd oh that makes sense, even better with dots, like: server.runid, server.*, memory.used.human, memory.used.bytes. But it's too late!
@chrstphd that's the kind of change that makes completely sense, but where the backward compatibility lost does not compensate for it.

@crodas you probably don't need this if you use maxmemory + maxmemory-policy all-lru. My far fetching worked this time? :-)

@cwsterling The easiest thing is to downgrade, run the script, then upgrade again. This is not great-- we're working to make it better!

@didier_06 thank you for your help!
@didip I don't think anyone tried SL (not sure it even compiles). It would be safer if you'd have access to a Linux box (or VM)
@didip if you benchmark it let us know as we'll be happy to help (and learn from your findings)
@didip Unfortunately Rethink doesn't build on Snow Leopard -- it's kernel is missing key features Rethink needs.
@diegor but when after debugging using this guidelines still the problem is odd, the software watchdog can provide a trace on hangs
@diegor cool. I assume the slow log is not logging nothing as well when you request the history?
@diegor if you tried everything at https://olegdb.org/wztTZv? I suggest to give the Software Watchdog of Redis a try...
@diegor thanks Diego, have a good WE as well
@diegor there are many reasons for this, like: you run out of ram and the system swaps, or many others, all listed in that page
@diem_perdidi don't wait for crashes! Simulate it. The key for good HA is to make an exception the rule.

@digitalhit https://olegdb.org/188X633? should work. Switch 5.5 in the URL for the right version, ie: 5.1 if you are using an older version.
@digitalpoint Agreed and good luck! Please let us know how it went.
@digitalpoint It should be possible to run Cluster via SDP using LD_PRELOAD (much like Dolphin super sockets). Have you tried that?

@dvillalobosc -- what are you looking for?
@dvirsky also, there is no something like a "setex" event, it is set + expire. That makes sense indeed as two events.
@dvirsky basically because of cosmic rays we should be prepared to have a small percentage of crashes that will never be explained ...
@dvirsky btw when I want to test it I just use "SCRIPT KILL" on the slave or master connection, but I would love to see some real live stuff
@dvirsky good idea? probably commits in the 2.8 branch about keyspace notifications will merge without complains
@dvirsky if I publish both set and incr events one can select what to trap, but it increases bandwidth needs for clients listening.
@dvirsky I'm doing something like that, for instance "incrby" is the event for incr, decr, incrby, ? So it is specific but generic enough
@dvirsky issue #804
@dvirsky I think it's better if the user uses more "ifs" instead :-) it is a tradeoff on bandwidth if(event == incr || set || ?)
@dvirsky I think object *creation* is too level, but even if you think about pre-existing key, what does INCR? It sets, or incr? :-)
@dvirsky it is an *extremely* common problem apparently? this patch may give us a much better idea of the size of the issue.
@dvirsky my initial measurements show no performance issues, btw the work performed is tunable via two defines.
@dvirsky no design, just an issue, but if I go that route there are too many things like that, like, expire is also a del? And so forth.
@dvirsky Possible indeed :-) Or set an unreasonable timeout for replication so that from time to time the connection will be dropped.
@dvirsky yep I've tethering indeed, this could be simpler, good idea
@dvirsky yes: a) turn it into slave (default). b) SHUTDOWN it. c) Nothing (old behavior).
@dvirsky yes I read this blog post, it's interesting, but how to verify it? We know only if the memory is broken and testing shows it.

@GeorgeSibble,  @ReQL_Mancer has your back, table.filter({"foreign_key" : Y}) works.
@GeorgeSibble some hacked together javascript tools and A LOT of patience :)

Hint about observability, redis-cli --bigkeys can provide informations about keys that are using a lot of memory in your data set.
Hint: if you shard client side moving keys into spare nodes can allow you to perform cross-nodes intersections or alike.

it's important to always reminder how broken makefile dependencies may lead to crash after a "git pull" changing structures inside .h files

@izavits keep docs smaller :)
@izavits weeeee ;)
@izs as a rule of thumb, anything that touches JS won?t handle attachments.
@izs @_jhs https://olegdb.org/tumblr_mqvgvkykBg1rzez4vo1_500.gif??
@izs not possible, sorry!
@izs sorry :D
@j14159 @al3xandru Jeremy, I might take you up on it. Always wanted to visit Vancouver!
@jac_ Awesome! :D
@jackgringo yeah, no worries, it?ll get to you :)
@_jacksmith I: we don't have multi-op transactions. Concluding (finally:-): we are not strictly ACID, but offer some of those guarantees
@jaganadhg just create a new user
@jaganadhg Ouch, man! :)
@jaganadhg reduce can be tricky. Try to boil it down to the builtin _count _sum or _ stats reduces.
@jaganadhg yay! :)
@JaimeObregon \m/
@jalejandrovc uh what?
@jalex19100 at least they were comfy read leather seats! :)
@james_womack Thanks! *blush* :D
Jan & Friends drinks at Gestalt (https://olegdb.org/?) tonight at 8pm. See you there! If you want to have dinner before, ping me via DM.
@jankrems do you have validation functions on the target that might exclude some of your docs?
@jankrems if you do one-off replication, you will get a report back about the number of docs that weren?t replicated.
@jankrems It is hard to reconcile everything that is out there. The guide will be added to docs at some point e.g.
@jankrems thanks! Did you get to that from our downloads page?
@jankrems thanks for the heads-up! :)
@jankrems yeah, that is a bit odd. I?ll pass this on to the ASF infra team. Thanks again!
@jankrems yep, sorry about that. The mirrors should be updated soon.

@jan_welker I can do HTTP basic auth, OAuth, encrypted cookie auth and SSL. Need more?
@jareiko the 3, even if similar at the data model,have major diffs that would force a lib to be either extremely extremely smart or dummy :)
@jasonweiler Totally agreed, we addressed the issue in 2009, when it came up: https://olegdb.org/pr0n_on_the_couch.html??
@jathanism you are encouraged to use the builtin _sum _stats and _count reduces for best performance. :)

@jistr the limiting factor is docids. Since deletes replicate, even deleted ids must be persisted.
@jistr There is a purge function or you can rotate database files, or reuse ids after deleting docs.
@JivaDeVoe that's what I'm for!
@jjmerelo I don?t know what the ?problem? is :)
@jjmerelo It depends a little on the error, sometimes you do get an alert, but yes, things could be improved. Do you feel like helping out?

@joerussbowman yeah, that works, too.
@joesteeve I sync your personal data :)
@joeyrobert fixed now. Ty!
@jofell all three can work together. We are planning a plugin system to make it easier.
@jofell But really, compressing on server & client is really the way to go.
@jofell hm no, I've never done that. You can upload folders with the CouchApp tool though.
@jofell I don't think there is community fragmentation, there are only different projects that we have all intents of joining.
@jofell zip is different from tar + zip. You can upload attachmens (compressed or not) and I can transparently decompress them for you.
@johanneshoff @HerokuAddons it's a third party service. We'll ping them to see if they decided to shut down.
@john_chandler Clean the flat of course. Oh wait... :)
@john_chandler yeah! :) -- Sorry about that flat :)
@johnmcbride you can embed me, but there's still a "server". But users don't have to see that or deal with it.
@johnsdoeser but if you want to go distributed, I strongly recommend to redesign the app so that transactions are not needed.
@johnsdoeser for instance by handling possible inconsistencies, or sometimes just re-ordering the operations.
@johnsdoeser FWIW EVAL with a single key as argument is going to be supported by Redis Cluster as well.
@johnsdoeser Multi-key probably it's impossible. Single-key maybe is possible using EVAL if supported.
@johnsdoeser well, actually, disregard the "reordering" thing, is fragile. Much better to deal with inconsistencies + EVAL.

@JoL1hAHN in the case of Lua and Predis there is the advantage that both the languages handle numerical 0 as false, so really ideal here.
@JoL1hAHN @redisfeed We just moved part of our cache from Memcache to Redis/Predis (a few millions items a day). Congrats for the great work

@justinko Only one answer -- complete control over performance.
@Justin_Mandzik  No problem, thanks for the bug report, that works too!
@justinsheehy @mrb_bk @pbailis my feeling is that KV looks distr. because natural (forced) sharding simplicity. See Twemproxy for instance.
@justinsheehy @mrb_bk @pbailis Redis stable (2.6) distributed features are just Sentinel and the MIGRATE command.

@jzawodn indeed? since Redis 2.6 we handle that better (issue #633 on GitHub), but probably there is still to work on that.
@k2xl a very brief comparison until we put more docs out https://olegdb.org/item?id=4764137?
Kairos looks pretty cool too. AND it uses Redis. https://olegdb.org/kairos??
@kake26 @40square there's no schema for science.
@kantrn for reliability my file format is append-only. Therefore the file size will grow to infinity unless you compact.
@kantrn you don't want to trigger compaction on an already overloaded server, so the daemon would have to be clever. We'll get there...
@kapso @mcsseifer it'll take a little bit of time to do right, but it will happen
@kapso we'll have to sift through all suggested features, but afaict secondary indexes is at the top
@karl_grz And... it's out!
@karl_grz A recording should be available, we'll let you know when it's out.
@karl_grz we'd really love to offer it to you 2d ago (we'd need to figure out how to reverse time). But we're on track to release it soon
@karlseguin we'll have something better for these pretty soon so we hope to change "want to" to "starting to" or even "liking"

@kellabyte +1, still it is an extremely under-exploited feature of Redis but I'm sure it's a matter of time.
@kellabyte @jrecursive @aphyr Most don't do it because it's hard, not because it's expensive. There are performance concerns if misused
@kellabyte thanks for the hint, I was not aware of that.
@kellogh in the future most probably yes, but it's a complex project
@kellogh oh, it's not about hate. But we went very deep into Linux and such. Plus some of our dependencies might not be available on Win
@Keltounet hmm, interesting. Are you connected to the server with a browser? That does a lot, and isn't free :)
@Keltounet I hate our build system :) we're gonna fix it, but there are deeper portability issues that'll prevent you from simply compiling
@Keltounet the web UI polls the server for stats which can be quite expensive. We'll try to optimize this for 1.4.
@Keltounet yes, but we'll try to make it easier to get it to run on OS X (with a VM for dev/testing)
@Keltounet yes, linux only for the time being

@kralcttam you can but puh-lease don't! :)
@KrisBuytaert sorry, thats been fixed :)
@krnlpanic actually not, it is possible that we go to the opposite direction: CONFIG SET ? and then CONFIG REWRITE.
@krnlpanic it is currently not possible, but I just added it to my TODO list
@krnlpanic so you reconfigure Redis on the fly, and then you tell Redis to rewrite your config file accordingly.

@LittleBuddha87 4s? Sounds good to me, no?
@LittleBuddha87 And your AS3 sorts things into a persistent btree and fsyncs to disk at the same time? #applesvsoranges
@LittleBuddha87 because it's incremental, as long as the view server can keep up with inserts and updates, you are in the clear.
@LittleBuddha87 how are you fetching it?
@LittleBuddha87 What is slow about it?
@LittleBuddha87 Yeah, that should be quick, but I don't know your hard and software config, so I can't tell. Also, it's a one-time cost.

@LogaRhythm No needs for any erlangs :)
@LongJohnJohn However in the long term I want this to get more automatic than that.
@LongJohnJohn it is possible that in the first version of Cluster we'll use Sentinel to perform failover of broken masters.
@LongJohnJohn Sentinel will *surely* be around after Cluster as Redis Cluster is just a subset of Redis so not always suitable...
@LongJohnJohn the point is, using Sentinel we'll have Redis Cluster out usable *much faster* than otherwise possible.
long story short, without the Linux-specific API SO_KEEPALIVE is perfectly useless as the first ack will be sent in, like, one hour.

@marcgravell hey, you mean Redis Cluster? There is surely enough in the unstable branch to write a client library indeed.
@marcgravell if you place a Sentinel in every arm of your net and setup the quorum high enough accordingly, no failover will start
@marcgravell in order to setup a cluster for your tests I suggest reading this: https://olegdb.org/TP3D6n? "How to play with Redis Cluster"
@marcgravell my feeling is that now what's missing from the initial Sentinel picture is support to shutdown ghost instances reappearing.
@marcgravell Sentinels location + configured quorum basically select many different tradeoffs accordingly to exact net setup.
@marcgravell that was fast! Thank you :-)

@mark_ellul here's a 2 part series https://olegdb.org/epAsRi
@mark_ellul welcome, let me know if I can help.
@marklucovsky absolutely, key expiration, and even eviction (when maxmemory is set and Redis removes stuff to free mem).
@marklucovsky because when reliability is needed there is the problem that Pub/Sub is fire-and-forget
@marklucovsky in the new branch there is already support for "expired" events. Now the idea is to allow for optional queueing into a list
@marknca Erlang views can be significantly faster :)
@marknca it depends a little on document size e.g. but we've seen 2x-10x faster view builds compared to JS views.
@marknca parallel should be slightly faster unless your disk i/o is really slow.
@markobonaci feel free to ping us if you need any help with anything. (oh, and enjoy!)

Next thing to improve in Sentinel is detection of changed master for clients not explicitly monitoring Sentinels via Pub/Sub (most clients)
@nguyenvannhu I store JSON as Erlang terms, so yeah, BigNums ftw. When passing through JS-views you get JS-precision, though.
@NickBruun indeed storage is not very efficient. Yet :-). We know how and have a plan to address this in the next releases
@NickBruun Let us know what you find!!
@nicohofmann you might prefer homebrew, has more packages than MacPorts these days, too. https://olegdb.org/homebrew
@niftydigits @potatobristol @rickhurst zing :D
@nightshade427 nice :)
@NikolasAdair hehe!
@nileshgr @SathyaBhat hi - its already packaged, it shouldn't fail to compile. If it does, pls report a bug! https://olegdb.org/YpBNDS?
@nileshgr some of the code comes from them, so it should be copyright them. GPL says we have to list all copyright holders
@nimnull @BooBSD Primary key ?????? unique. ????????? unique ??????? ? distributed ???????? ?????? ??? ACID.
@niwibe spec ????? ????????, ???????? ???????? ??? ??????!
@njrabit @shinydistractns @Wikipedia yeah, this would}t be immediately easy, but longer-term, a fun project to tackle :)
@nlothian hi :)
@nlothian i support that.

No semantical changes, basically, but, if in the future we want the concept of "near keys" we'll not need to break compatibility.
Not at #mysqlconnect? Read about why I'm excited about the new 5.6.7 release candidate at https://olegdb.org/UXWwwS?
@notdaniel @5sf We love 5-Second Films! If you need help with anything, just let us know.
Note: if you need a Redis server consuming as little CPU as 2.4 when idle (on load CPU usage is the same) recompile with REDIS_HZ set to 10
Note: issue #754 turned out to be not an issue at all. Thanks to @superfeedr for the support. Link: https://olegdb.org/PAFzGI?
Notes on distributed systems for young bloods https://olegdb.org/??
@notessensei if you know Erlang, it's not hard to write custom auth handers. Here's the code: https://olegdb.org/gpuMqp
@notessensei Who what now?
Note that this is the first stable version of Redis that is able to report the amount of memory consumed by copy-on-write while saving.
Note that with a decent box/disk you don't have the AOF rewrite latency problem at all. But it's good we can improve the poor HW numbers.
Note: the implementation may change significantly in the final version, but the general idea is about what you see implemented there.
Note: the RESTORE commit is already at github, the MIGRATE + COPY thing will be committed shortly.
@NotThatDoug somewhere in between -- it almost certainly won't happen for at least ~6 months.
Not to be outshone by dch_, I have also been accepted as a member of @TheASF. :D
Now Available: Two-Factor Authentication for MMS Backup via Google Authenticator https://olegdb.org/18r7wsP?
Now includes a chapter on scripting! RT: @ManningBooks The #Redis in Action MEAP (https://olegdb.org/HHC9ZN? ) has been updated!
now Sentinel sends CONFIG REWRITE when changing role of a Redis instance. This makes it a better at handling a few failure modes: upgrade.
Now testing with care that everything works as expected, and later today releasing 2.6.11 with all the changes.
Now that issue 1072 is fixed, there is just to test more the Sentinel master demote code. Then we are ready for Redis 2.6.13.
Now unstable and 2.8 branch return -WRONGTYPE instead of -ERR for commands against wrong type kind of errors.
@npmjs <3 you too!
@npmjs Hooray :)
@npmjs @ibobrik unless it is a dirty document that causes havoc once replicated. But these *should* have been shaken out for a while now.
@npmjs @trolleymusic @npmjseu I?m trying, though! :D
@nslater @microsnot @davecottlehuber @davisp aye, thanks.
@nslater Thanks! :)
@nsomnac thanks :) -- hi @eneko!
@nsteinmetz lists are for views, shows are for docs. they are just different tools :)
@nsteinmetz thanks for the report. They should be up-to-date soon. For now, selecting another mirror should work.
@nviennot it's already on the community wiki on github! Looking forward to playing with it over the holidays!
@nviennot That's a problem -- we don't want people confused about site ownership. Sorry!
@nviennot there is no ORM integration yet that we know of. I don't know yet if we'll do it ourselves or wait for the community contributions

Oh, another interesting issue. Should INCR* by propagated as a SET event? or a special INCR event...
OH at #erlangfactory:
OH: "Couch is so cool it hurts": awwww <blushes>
Ohm is an object-hash mapper for Redis. Take a look at the changes in version 2: https://olegdb.org/CHANGELOG.md??
Oh, one of the effects of partial resync code: a global replication offset in INFO. Easy to check if a slave is aligned with its master.
Oh wait, I just fixed the bug in the two branches, it was trivial fortunately. I wrote that code on steroids? -> https://olegdb.org/c151eb6d92ae69a8fecf14f7429d38929e0c75d0??
OK. I?m officially blown away with CouchApp. Great concept.
OK now this is stretching things a bit: cluster of "virtual" Redis nodes in a master/slave setup https://olegdb.org/4959926#file-example-php?? #redis #predis #php
Ok, source of the issue discovered, it was so obvious that I missed it at first. BYTE_ORDER macro is set in the wrong way.
ok, thank you, basically the :1 / :0 change will break a lot of clients? probably this will be changed into +OK / +NOOP.

One of our redis servers has processed over 100 billion commands in 128 days. Another has done 44 billion in the same time.
One of the functionalities of the old redis-tools ported to redis-cli. "redis-cli --stat" output is like this https://olegdb.org/WSK8zU?
One of the left problems in PSYNC implementation just fixed. We are definitely a step forward to having that merged into unstable.
one of the things that you learn from big companies is despite all the cool new technologies, all of them use old proven tech (except redis)
One thing I like about #novacut is that it is a rare example of Open Source competing with the cloud rather than yell obscenities at it

@orkj Cool! Right now you're expected to open a connection on every web request. Is pooling an issue for you?
@orkj docs on the site should be updated now. (there's another round we plan to do though :-)
@orkj sorry -- the release process took longer than expected. New docs should be up in a few hours!

@paul_dipietro very cool! Is it an internal app or something that we'll have a chance to see?
@paulmatthews86 just be careful, we're used for completely different things :)
@paulmatthews86 There's ready-to-use PHP libraries for me, too. No need to hassle with HTTP details or compiling native drivers (cc @antz29)
@paulmcclean awww :)
@pavlobaron give us a couple more days and we'll have something nice and hopefully interesting for you. Thanks for putting us on your list.
@pavlobaron we'll make sure you'll be one of the firsts to hear about it
@pbailis Peter, these are great questions, but can't address in 140 chars :) Will write a post in the next few days.
@pbailis very interesting blog post, this year we'll finally seriously explore distribution with Redis, I'll make a note about HAT.
@pcapr enjoy :) https://olegdb.org/1??
@pcapr https://olegdb.org/nodeoncouch??
@pcapr No, not yet, since it is a simple file system directory traversal. It should be easy to add. Do you mind filing an issue?
@pcapr oh oh oh :)
@pcapr patches welcome :)
@pcapr reports have been between 2x and 10x depending on the views and hardware of course.
@pcapr Since this is a file system issue, unless we  have a good low level API, this may be "hard" either way :(
@pcapr They run in the same process (with full access to the VM (!)) and they don't marshall any JSON.
@pcapr Well deserved! :)
@pcapr You mean an _update function?
@pchapuis fixed :)
@pchapuis many companies are near this range, including Pinterest. 4096 seems low at this point...
@pchapuis sure, this does not limit Redis usefulness in the general case. Just people are using it also as a queue SDK.
@pdincau there you go :-) /cc @MirkoBonadei pic.twitter.com/BXqnVIFfz3
@pedromelo actually you should receive the message exactly after 1 second, not after two in most cases
@pedromelo and that's the result -> https://olegdb.org/WsBdRW?
@pedromelo A partial sync request is followed by a message "+CONTINUE" or "+FULLRESYNC <new-global-offset>"
@pedromelo are you saying I should not use every occasion to show my command line abilities? ;-) Thanks for the hint!
@pedromelo because it's like REPLCONF partial-resync <offset>, that may be ok now, but when you ask for SYNC the buffer may already be gone!
@pedromelo cool :-) are you adding it as a command or as an argument for the constructor function?
@pedromelo for this specific test I would need to test the socket timeout from the OS point of view, there are syscalls to do that but? ;)
@pedromelo great Pedro! With the argument in the constructor it is much more natural to use compared to sending the command.
@pedromelo I'm reluctant about that because unfortunately with the offset the return type of the command changes...
@pedromelo in that case you wait for rename_to.
@pedromelo it appears to work actually, did you enabled notifications with --notify-keyspace-events yes ?
@pedromelo no rush! It's just a first version in a separate branch, if it is bugged we'll discover it tomorrow :-)
@pedromelo no sure I understand, but trying this example myself to see what happens
@pedromelo np probably there are no big news for you :-) But a lot of info for newcomers that is not clearly stated elsewhere.
@pedromelo so for instance you may want to refresh a client cache as long as the new generated sorted set is moved on place.
@pedromelo @SusanPotter good point, thanks!
@pedromelo that's what I receive -> https://olegdb.org/11RF1C7?
@pedromelo the idea is that you don't need to connect the two, but just that with the two events we better specify deletion / overwrite.
@pedromelo there is a public branch now! So you can test it if you feel like that :-) Btw I'll change details for sure a few times.
@pedromelo we take your tweet as a feature request :-) https://olegdb.org/ThA42O? please comment if you can think to something more. Thank you!
@pedromelo yep? actually I was hoping to avoid any new command at all and just use REPLCONF to set more state, but it is impossible.
@pencilcasestudi it's a RC. The GA version will be out in the Spring
Pentaho Big Data Forum in Washington DC is on April 23, featuring @10gen's @wlaforest https://olegdb.org/13piduW?
People asking me about @vmware and the cut, everything is fine. But don't think that anyway Redis development could end like that.
People still don't get the (public) cloud basics properties: they are fluffy and fuzzy. If you want hard guarantees look elsewhere. #pgeast
@perezd any suggestions for Ruby features / requirements?
@perezd I want bcrypt too. @fdmanana wrote a patch for that once.

@PerilousApricot excellent!
@PerilousApricot generally: start at the top.
@PerilousApricot nope.
@PerilousApricot not yet :)
@PerilousApricot paste it somewhere?
@PerilousApricot You mean http://bigcouch.cloudant.com?? :)
@peterc Totally :) I?ll be in touch!
@peterc very good slides, thanks Peter!
@peterjschwarz Yeah, working hard in it actually :)
@peterslizik considered and avoided for two reasons: 1) Performance. 2) It's not cool to call it like redis.set(?., time.to_s+"ms") IMHO.
@pfreixes it depends largely, but concurrent bulk requests can max out your IO.
@pfreixes p.s. I updated the reply with more details, there is a new INFO thing in 2.6 that you may not be aware of.
@pfreixes we just replied while you eat cake as in the picture
@pfreixes yeah, that can happen. In practice, you*very* rarely have serial writes. Concurrent single writes are plenty fast.

@postwait + #esper at #pgEast == coincidentally well timed talk.
Presentation available for webinar where we examine schema design insights and trade-offs using real world examples: https://olegdb.org/1fZXNtG?
@presidentbeef are you on the import or export step? What does the web ui dash say? What about top/htop and iotop? (Also, post on github!)
@presidentbeef backups! (sorry, man)
@presidentbeef I think it does, but I need to check with @neumino how it works
@presidentbeef Sorry -- 1.5 will have much better bulk insert performance.

Profiling afternoon shows it again, that there are many rooms for speed improvements in Redis. Hopefully something will go into 2.8.
Programming is a Pop Culture https://olegdb.org/programming-is-a-pop-culture??. But it *is* also a science and a craft.
@properlofi you may wanna check a binary build: https://olegdb.org/?? ? What should I drop, though?
Proper regression test for issue #828 is fragile and will not be added, but just manually tested the patch and works as expected.
@pro_suja party! :)
Protobufs ported to Python 3: https://olegdb.org/protobufs-ported-to-python-3?? This will be useful.
@prudhviy In the distributed case, that queue would be forever. -- In the single node case, you might accidentally overwrite data.
@prudhviy @mahendra Indeed :)
@prudhviy no worries, I got a little over-excited as well :)
@prudhviy Very! :
@psankar probably not (yet). But I do sync and I am plenty fast.
Psync is working great in the tests after the latest fixes you can find in the "psync" branch at Github.
psync preview #2 just rebased to unstable.
PSYNC was just merged into 2.8 and unstable branches.
PSYNC working on the master side (however not 100% finished). Moving to the slave side to have both sides interacting as expected.
Publish more open source, not less. "Too much noise" is a terrible excuse. Publish wisdom so we may use. Publish mistakes so we may learn.
@Pullfolio lemme know if I can help
@PunkChameleon not yet, I?m HTTP all the way.
punsubscribe / unsubscribe without arguments fixed, now both commands will reply even if no action is performed.

@RaffiMinassian cc @dch @wohali etc :)
@RaffiMinassian thanks a lot for caring! <3
@RaffiMinassian we are working on it, but we could do with help. Are you volunteering?
@railshoster since creating invoice numbers is probably not a concurrent thing, you should be fine.
@rajrikhy thanks Raj. Any docs to start with before getting to emails? /cc @brandon_weiss
@Ramoonus  -- thx, fixing it
@ramsesmoya me :)
Ran ~200 tests to get a performance profile for a new SSD drive. There is a 15x difference between the worst and the best workload.
@Random_Nerds that?s pretty cool! Just a note on the versioning: compaction will remove old versions, you shouldn?t rely on them!
Range queries bug is fixed FYI
@ravisarma it's `getAll` in JS, and `get_all` in Python and Ruby. Rethink uses native language conventions (which is camelCase in JS)
@rbranson don't get excited ;) The command is only issued by slaves and is not documented as SYNC was not. You should pay more attention!
@rbranson @mipsytipsy Secondary idxes were three releases ago (only a few months, but feels like forever!) Master reelection is coming soon!
@rbucker Hmm, what was the error? May be we can help get it to work.
@rbucker Homebrew just accepted the new formula for 1.7.1, so you should be able to update now!
@rbucker That's a great idea, we're considering it for community libs (that is, other than our official Ruby, Python, and JavaScript libs!)
@rbucker We're working on getting the pull request accepted by @MacHomebrew (https://olegdb.org/20989??). Sorry for the delay!
@rcrsv it probably means you're connecting to the wrong port. What are you trying to connect, and to which port?
@rdmpage @chrisfreeland if you want a me wiki, check out https://olegdb.org/pages?
@rdmpage Cool, whatcha hackin??

@rdmpage Nice, thanks, keep it up! :) -- let me know if you have any questions.
@rdmpage @PaulMurrayCbr cool :) let me know if I can be of any help!
@rdmpage very cool, is it gonna be available anywhere?

@redisfeed @Pinterest that was months ago, he said they are now over 200 redis servers.
@redisfeed p.s. if you ask me, I would always put many Sentinels and configure an high quorum, so that failover happens only in safe moments
@redisfeed there is a new retwis app, written in clojure https://olegdb.org/?

@redis_green suggestion: write that EVAL will automatically load the script and SCRIPT LOAD is usually not needed as EVALSHA will complain.
@redis_green thanks, predis should handle it as well and a few other libs, but I don't remember what other exactly.

@rhoml If it is just a cache, you can implement simply consistent hashing (some client can do it for you), memcached style.
@rhoml is auto ejection enabled?
@rhoml it depends on your unique requirements, load, cache durability needs. I suggest writing down requirements before designing.
@rhoml sorry on Twitter I can't provide this kind of support. I suggest you posting to Redis Group, there are a lot of helpful guys there.
@richard_lopes curious, what is Weta?
@richard_lopes Let me know if I can help with anything.

@RickIsRandom look into $prefix/share/www/script
@RickIsRandom No really, it is in https://olegdb.org/jquery.couch.js ? replace 127.0.0.1:5984 with wherever your server is.
@RickIsRandom or the ones in /_utils/script/
@RickIsRandom sorry. Bad info earlier.  the org prefix is ugly like that because it's hard coded. Patches welcome to add config.
@RickIsRandom thanks <3
@RickIsRandom /_utils/scripts/jquery.couch.js is on every server :)
@RickIsRandom Yeah, just hack up your jquery.couch.js or couch.js files.
@RicoTweet We need help building them, wanna help out?
Right now it is a more complex stuff than believed because we are trying to do the object decoding only one time for all the slaves.

@rmurphey \o/ glad to hear it! Let me know if you have any questions
@rnhurt And it's back up, should be working now. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ping us on Twitter or IRC.
@rnhurt I'm checking with our provider about an ongoing service issue. I'll ping you when it's back up! Sorry for the inconvenience.

@roguejs There?s a Futon2 rewrite underway and a mobile version, making views more easy to query, etc.
@roguejs what exactly are you looking for? if you have specific wishes, why not open issues for them?
@roidrage I'll be here for long time.
@roidrage it is correct to say that ever time Redis needs CPU the hypervisor does not provide enough in this graphs?
@roidrage it's something like "as long as you don't need CPU, you have all the CPU you want".
@roidrage LAZURLULZ!
@roidrage makes sense as saving is both sys-CPU and user-CPU intensive at the same time. Thanks for the info.
@RolandGiersig users either have access to an entire database or not. There is no fine-grained control over views etc https://olegdb.org/afC1PD
@ronnypfannsch There is no change notification yet. Replication is available on table-per-table basis.
@rootslab Lua struct library was bugged in Redis, upgraded to latest version (0.2) and now everything is fine, even according to valgrind.

@sbtourist Hi Sergio, writing good docs is really hard :) In the meantime, anything in particular you'd like to know?
@sbtourist If you set acks == replicas, you get full sync replication. It's really easy to do in the UI and works quite well. Try it!
@sbtourist @pbailis no quorums necessary for reads -- you only need to go to master, so you don't have to wait on multiple machines
@sbtourist @pbailis Yes, it's monodic on a per-connection level. You'll never see v1 v3 v2 or any quirks like that.
@sbtourist @pbailis yes, that's correct -- rethink doesn't break the laws of physics :)
@sbtourist You specify how many acks you want, and the server doesn't ack the client until enough replicas acked the write.

Sentinel documentation now updated with "resurrecting master" handling documentation: https://olegdb.org/PovWoy?
Sentinel is definitely the hot topic in the Redis mailing list...
Sentinel is evolving into a more reliable system as users deploy it more. It's becoming one of the key components of the Redis ecosystem.
Sentinel master-back reconfiguration code improved a bit more? testing one more hour, if everything is fine 2.6.13 will be out today.
Sentinel: master demote working well, next scenario to test better is the "reboot hell" where everything fails and reappears later.
Sentinel update: work in progress to add support to automatically turn resurrecting master into slave. Commit already in "unstable".
Sentinel users: update your sentinels to latest "unstable" branch when you can because get-master-addr-by-name works better now.

@softwareweaver Not yet. We're going to release new driver spec soon, lots of new drivers should follow after that.
so glad that after many (5?) years of campaigning @janl finally convinced the world that offline matters for the web!
So if the master is PSYNC capable we continue with "PSYNC <offset>", otherwise we use the old "SYNC" as usually, to work with old masters.
@solidsnack @codesurgeon this is likely a 1.7 feature (after secondary indexes in 1.5, and performance in 1.6). We're working hard on this!
@Solidus117 Not yet -- we'll add driver implementors guide ASAP. We'd love for you to help!

@stardog101 ah cool. I don't think it would be very difficult.
@stardog101 Feel free to ping us with any questions, we're here to help out!
@stardog101 sounds pretty cool! anything out there in the wild? drop us a line when there's something. thanks and have fun!
Starting from friday I'll take a few days in order to switch to the new house. Mail me for critical stuff, I'll keep an eye to emails. Thx!
Starting with Redis 2.8 to log to the standard output you need logfile "", instead of logfile "stdout".
@Stavros a few people reported this, we're on it
@stay_positive And you are worried that the same doc gets transmitted multiple times?
@stay_positive a true substring search is done with doc.field.split("").forEach(...) emitting every n-gram in your text.
@stay_positive doc.fields.split(" ").forEach(function(word) {emit(word);} )
@stay_positive for something like that you'd want to emit a timestamp as key, and then you could do startkey and endkey instead of limit.
@stay_positive function(doc) { doc.types.forEach(function(type) { emit(type, null);}} -- And see https://olegdb.org/g1qFTd
@stay_positive include_docs and pagination are not related.
@stay_positive It's just geohashing, you can just use views for that.
@stay_positive other option is to have a list function process the results and have it handle the limit by returning early.
@stay_positive simple solution is to emit(doc.timetamp, {news_doc : doc, _id : doc.author}) in a single row
@stay_positive Yes it can: https://olegdb.org/Geohash? :)
@stay_positive You're welcome :)
@stefanjudis ty!
@stelcheck also,replication running fine here, CPU bound but staying well within memory. It will take a while to get to 40GB. /cc @dch__
@stelcheck I'd love to get my hands on the logfile. Can you PM @dch__ some details?
@stelcheck IIRC this is caused by lack of memory on the box. Is that likely?
@stelcheck likely you switched from continuous replication (async == return) to one-shot (sync == waits til finished replication) ?
@stelcheck @maciejmalecki @dscape weekend, give the devs some slack :)
@stelcheck @npmjs definitely does not sound typical! Maybe you can post a log somewhere.
@stelcheck @npmjs good luck!
@stelcheck @npmjs restart the replication once more :)
@stelcheck @npmjs yeah, sorry about the initial trouble, it should be smooth sailing after that :)
@stelcheck thank you!
@stelcheck we?re looking for volunteers. Fancy helping out?
@StephenMelrose @kaerast @TomNomNom I can ensure you I'll drive you *away* from Redis if I understand it's a bad pick for you.
@StephenMelrose @kaerast @TomNomNom more generally, if you want to discuss that with me, I'm available tomorrow afternoon for IRC.
@StephenMelrose @kaerast @tomnomnom not sure about your comment, I'm talking about that: https://olegdb.org/11MvP23?
@StephenMelrose @kaerast @TomNomNom what about AOF + fsync every sec? you get safety and very good perf.
Stephen Wolfram: The Poetry of Function Naming https://olegdb.org/?? We are going through the same phase with our JS, Ruby, Python libraries
@sterex @remotezygote clients should reconfigure asking for config to sentinels on reconnection.
@sterex @remotezygote there is no proxy in the intended usage, but it could be used with a proxy if needed.
@SteveGreatrex upgrading is even easier, you can just re-use the 1.1-era .couch files in 1.2.
@SteveGreatrex yup :)

@stevey BBC and Meebo are both in the hundreds of millions of requests per day territory, running smoothly.
@stewartsmith totally true. I'm glad you're feeling better and have recovered fully.
@stewartsmith we'll sure be missing you. It would be great fun if you were at the @percona booth :)
@sthulbourn how was your #sharkswithlasers talk?
@stickbyatlas my wiki has an example config.
@stickbyatlas @rnewson replicate via Tor, for example.
@stigsb the most common reductions are builtin: _sum, _count and _stats.
@stigsb you mean editing the JavaScript source in emacs?
Still one slot left for our Thursday Meetup. Anyone wanna talk about something?
Still without tests but SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN are now part of the unstable branch. Soon into 2.8.
@stimms What are you doing? )
@stkerr88 glad to hear. Let me know if you need anything :)
@stkerr88 nope. User differentiation is only per-database.
@stkerr88 not possible, sorry!
@StopForumSpam absolutely not, there is a backlog configurable in size. If the slave reconnects too late, a full resync is performed.
@StopForumSpam But it is not impossible. However definitely hard with the current design. But something to take in mind for the future.
@StopForumSpam hey, what comments spam? Please give me the URL and I'll remove manually
@StopForumSpam https://olegdb.org/11fxnBs?
@StopForumSpam I'm opening an issue to investigate this stuff, thank you.
@StopForumSpam it is completely unrelated. What operations you want faster? There is a plan for "far" LRANGE ranges.
@StopForumSpam oh my, I was not aware there were spammer on github, not that kind of spammers!
@StopForumSpam oh ok I think I get it now :-) Basically that would be pretty hard to do
@StopForumSpam oh, we are talking about TCP packets, I think you are on something actually! Because we don't remove the TCP_NODELAY on SYNC
@StopForumSpam please could you explain that better? I'm not sure if you are talking about TCP packets or what
@StopForumSpam should not make a big difference since we now perform the three-way handshake only the first time MIGRATE is called. Thx!
@StopForumSpam thanks, I've a couple too, but if I'll need more I'll ping you for sure.
@StopForumSpam that's exactly what I'm working to right now, we'll have it in Redis 2.8
@strangeloop_stl thank you!
@streampunks BBC has at least 16 nodes in each datacenter, with multiple datacenters.
@streampunks Canonical hosts backup/sync data for millions of UbuntuOne users in a modest cluster.
@streampunks I got your back
@streampunks Meebo had 64 logical nodes on top of 16 physical boxes, like, 2 years ago. Must be more now.
@strlen @b6n Hi Alex - you'll never see v1 v3 v2. Reads are always monotonic without exception.
@strlen @jdoliner @rbranson @b6n Chained replication (syn or async -- up to the user)
@strmpnk Definitely possible! However as RDD1 states the "general" feature idea must be accepted before an RDD is published.
@strmpnk great! You are welcome :-)
@strmpnk mailing list is perfect indeed? I hope to use more the ML in the future for design discussions.
@stuartloxton thx 
@StuFFmc ah, odd, mind fixing the wiki? :)
@StuFFmc done :)
@StuFFmc Schuld be back up :)
@stulentsev Ok this crash makes more sense indeed? maybe I know what is happening. News ASAP
@stulentsev please stay tuned, the package building is temporarily experiencing technical difficulties :)
@stulentsev the crash report shows that this instance was many times target of SYNC, it also serves as a master for other slaves?
@subdigital even if caching surely helps here, this is not the fastest json implementation for sure ;) should not that 140 sec for 100 calls
@subdigital in contrast prefixed-len formats like 5:hello are much more efficient to produce.
@subdigital no conversion is the best for sure :-)
@subdigital oh ok that explains the timing, I was thinking just at the json conversion.
@subdigital personally I like MessagePack quite a bit, but with binary things debugging may be less trivial as usually ...
@subdigital the json escaping model forces a O(N) chars scan basically, since every special string char has to be quoted. Not good?
@sulmansarwar see the INSTALL.Unix file in the source tree.
@SumAll -- Hey guys, tweeting on our behalf isn't what we expected. This should be opt-in. Not cool!

@superfeedr here's a screencast about async applications https://olegdb.org/watch?v=WaH4_Hq33PI
@superfeedr i.e. it is not what you are asking for, but it is the way to do it "correctly".
@superfeedr it is :)
@superfeedr It is async from the CouchApp perspective. It's part of the basic promise that you don't mess with the request/response cycle.
@superfeedr that works, too :)
@superfeedr the error is triggered only after the specified script max execution time as configured by the user
@superfeedr the preferred approach is to use a sorted set if you want unique + ordered. Or a list + a set in combo.

@unbit very cool, ping us if you have any questions!
@unindicted have you run compaction like I suggested before?
@unindicted you mean you have ~70GB data in a database of ~70GB size?
@unindicted you want to run compaction :)
@un_i_ You can change the of acks in the replication view; version 1.5 will allow for "soft durability" which does exactly what you want.
unlike "monitor" this stuff is designed to be used in production high-traffic instances without killing the server, and with selectivity.

@user24 ah yes, sorry. That is the correct solution.
@user24 and try setting your log level to debug before checking couch.log
@user24 any other options in Futon that might break the result?
@user24 :D now worries, glad it is working now!
@user24 do you get anything in your couch.log? Also, are you sure slugify() is error free?
@user24 easiest to manually copy props.
@user24 it looks like all is well, just no documents matching your query.
@user24 look forward to the new Fauxton :)
@user24 oops :/
@user24 perfect, so you can run the requests in parallel, even less trouble :)
@user24 Please ask the @cloudant folks :)
@user24 references to fabric and rexi. I don?t have any of that (yet) :)
@user24 That looks like a BigCouch error.
@user24 the algorithmical complexity is the same and requests are cheap :)
@user24 the result has a `total_rows` member.
@user24 you don?t want to use require() in a loop, but that should still work. What error are you getting?
@user24 you totally can in 1.1.0 and later.

WAIT: synchronous replication for Redis => https://olegdb.org/66?
@walla76 1) the on disk format is log-structured (good for I/O); 2) we don't do yet any data compression but arch will allow us to do that
@walla76 3) handling blobs should work well, but that's not exposed yet in the friendliest way
@walla76 that's the shortest answer I could put in 140chars :-). Drop by irc or our google group if you want more details
@wallentins @40square @nodejs That'd be awesome :)
@wallrat Best reply I can give in 140 chars is: we'll just have a facility to take single snapshots of single nodes with just one command.
@wallrat but it is not point-in-time, if not from the point of view of single nodes. Otherwise you would need cluster-wide transactions.
@wallrat however Redis Cluster nodes should use AOF, so in general there is no much window of desync but a few seconds at max.
@wallrat if you have any question please feel free to write in the google group where I can provide a better reply! :-)
@wallrat in general with cluster programs must be written so that if a key was set and some other related key is not (or stale), is ok.
@wallrat It will not be possible to get a point-in-time backup of the whole cluster, but redis-trib will be able to centralize saving.
@wallrat not sure I understand. Basically every node has it's own AOF file. Redis-trib backup is just a facility to get all the data.
@wallrat of course when you do the cluster-wide snapshot, you don't want to reshard at the same time, so keys will not move.
@wallrat yes please open an issue where the problem is described, I'll address it ASAP. Thanks!
@walming there are plenty of folks using me with big data.

Warning, a memory leak was introduced in all the branches yesterday after a refactoring. It never ended a stable release and is now fixed.
Warning: API change in Redis 2.8 and unstable branches (will not affect 2.6). Now TTL returns -2 for non existing keys (-1 if no expire set)
Warning: Redis >= 2.8 will return -NOAUTH on authentication error instead of the generic error. Make sure this does not break your code. Thx
Warning: the "hiredis" repository was moved to https://olegdb.org/hiredis?. Please upgrade your pointers. Redis.io will be upgraded in minutes.

@westonruter got it. the megadoc may work out, but _update still reads it from disk into memory fully, so it's not "ideal".
@westonruter I might be the wrong tool for the job. -- But do write the mailing list to see what the others come up with :)
@westonruter knee-jerk idea: import each word as a separate document and store the position number with it. Use a view to sort.
@westonruter @natevw I hear there are more active forks.
@westonruter you can use an _update function to update that saving wire-transport. But a doc that large sounds like wrong architecture.
