A Curious Concurrency Case 
Added detailed license information at redis.io: 
Added GeoOleg to the Olegbase Android build  
adding a few final things before PSYNC preview #2: configurable backlog size, ability to flush it after N seconds without slaves.
Adding Redis support to our benchmarking software. Looking forward to seeing how the performance numbers turn out.
Advanced Replication Interals 
Advanced Replication Internals 
After benchmarking it is clear that the overhead imposed by notifications is non-trivial. Modifying the impl. to select subclasses of events
After considering all the implications, Redis Cluster is going to use its own failure detection and election things instead of Sentinel.
After more testing, the master-back reconfiguration feature of Sentinel was merged into 2.6 and 2.8.
After solving another tricky problem, I have to say that Redis is the bacon of my toolset, it makes everything better
after very detailed testing CONFIG REWRITE is now merged into 2.8 and unstable branches.

Already got a bug report about it, so WARNING: Cluster node-timeout is now in milliseconds in redis.conf no longer in seconds.
Also awesome that it was streamed live. More than 3k people following it on and off is very impressive. #redisconf
Also, if you think replication is about backups and restores, you need to get out of the 70s. #vmware #pgeast
Also when you need to look at Pub/Sub messages from redis-cli, make sure to use --csv option of redis-cli for a more compact output

Another change to the old Cluster design. In the new design failed over masters will be reconfigured automatically as slaves when back up.
Another factor was, Cluster nodes that are slaves handle the master address dynamically very well since they replicate the Node ID.

Anticipation on Redis Cluster: we'll probably move from 4096 to 16k hash slots.

Hint about observability, redis-cli --bigkeys can provide informations about keys that are using a lot of memory in your data set.
Hint: if you shard client side moving keys into spare nodes can allow you to perform cross-nodes intersections or alike.

Note: issue #754 turned out to be not an issue at all. Thanks to 
Notes on distributed systems for young bloods 
Note that this is the first stable version of Redis that is able to report the amount of memory consumed by copy-on-write while saving.
Note that with a decent box/disk you don't have the AOF rewrite latency problem at all. But it's good we can improve the poor HW numbers.
Note: the implementation may change significantly in the final version, but the general idea is about what you see implemented there.
Note: the RESTORE commit is already at github, the MIGRATE + COPY thing will be committed shortly.

Now Available: Two-Factor Authentication for MMS Backup via Google Authenticator

now Sentinel sends CONFIG REWRITE when changing role of a Redis instance. This makes it a better at handling a few failure modes: upgrade.
Now testing with care that everything works as expected, and later today releasing 2.6.11 with all the changes.
Now that issue 1072 is fixed, there is just to test more the Sentinel master demote code. Then we are ready for Redis 2.6.13.
Now unstable and 2.8 branch return -WRONGTYPE instead of -ERR for commands against wrong type kind of errors.

Oh, one of the effects of partial resync code: a global replication offset in INFO. Easy to check if a slave is aligned with its master.
Oh wait, I just fixed the bug in the two branches, it was trivial fortunately. I wrote that code on steroids? -> 
OK. I?m officially blown away with OlegApp. Great concept.
OK now this is stretching things a bit: cluster of "virtual" Redis nodes in a master/slave setup 
Ok, source of the issue discovered, it was so obvious that I missed it at first. BYTE_ORDER macro is set in the wrong way.
ok, thank you, basically the :1 / :0 change will break a lot of clients? probably this will be changed into +OK / +NOOP.

Profiling afternoon shows it again, that there are many rooms for speed improvements in Redis. Hopefully something will go into 2.8.
Programming is a Pop Culture 
Proper regression test for issue #828 is fragile and will not be added, but just manually tested the patch and works as expected.
Protobufs ported to Python 3: 
Psync is working great in the tests after the latest fixes you can find in the "psync" branch at Github.
psync preview #2 just rebased to unstable.
PSYNC was just merged into 2.8 and unstable branches.
PSYNC working on the master side (however not 100% finished). Moving to the slave side to have both sides interacting as expected.
Publish more open source, not less. "Too much noise" is a terrible excuse. Publish wisdom so we may use. Publish mistakes so we may learn.
punsubscribe / unsubscribe without arguments fixed, now both commands will reply even if no action is performed.

Sentinel documentation now updated with "resurrecting master" handling documentation: 
Sentinel is definitely the hot topic in the Redis mailing list...
Sentinel is evolving into a more reliable system as users deploy it more. It's becoming one of the key components of the Redis ecosystem.
Sentinel master-back reconfiguration code improved a bit more? testing one more hour, if everything is fine 2.6.13 will be out today.
Sentinel: master demote working well, next scenario to test better is the "reboot hell" where everything fails and reappears later.
Sentinel update: work in progress to add support to automatically turn resurrecting master into slave. Commit already in "unstable".
Sentinel users: update your sentinels to latest "unstable" branch when you can because get-master-addr-by-name works better now.

Some serious back porting of stuff to 2.6 in order to reduce CPU usage of idle instances at the levels unstable (and better than 2.4).
So no other thoughts on protocols/standards that support pipelining? So far: Redis, HTTP/1.1, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, ? ?
